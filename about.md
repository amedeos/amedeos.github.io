I'm employed at [Nexi](https://www.nexi.it) where I work as Cloud Infrastructure Engineer.
My working, fighting days, are focused on trying to automate everything, especially 
OpenStack infrastructure, and applications deployments via Ansible.

During the free time I like to listen music and going outside to run.
