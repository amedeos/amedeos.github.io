I'm employed at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) where I work as Senior consultant.
My working, fighting days, are focused on trying to automate everything, especially 
OpenStack infrastructure, applications and infrastracture deployments via Ansible, and OpenShift hybrid cloud infrastructure.

During the free time I like to listen music and going outside to run.
